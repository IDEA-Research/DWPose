# Installation
## For MMPose
ðŸŒµ You can refer [MMPose Installation](https://mmpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) or
```
# Set environment
pip install torch==1.9.1+cu111 torchvision==0.10.1+cu111 torchaudio==0.9.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## For ControlNet
ðŸŒµ First, make sure to run ControlNet successfully.
```
# Set environment
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate control-v11
```
ðŸŒµ Second, install tools to apply DWPose to ControlNet. If it's hard to install mmcv, you can refer branch [onnx](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/DWPose/tree/onnx), which just needs onnxruntime.
```
# Set environment
pip install -U openmim
mim install mmengine
mim install "mmcv>=2.0.1"
mim install "mmdet>=3.1.0"
mim install "mmpose>=1.1.0"
```
